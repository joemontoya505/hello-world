# hello-world
We shall not cease from exploration
and the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started
and know the place for the first time
Through the unkown, remembered gate
When the last of earth left to discover
is that which was the beginning
At the source of the longest river,
The voice of the Hidden waterfall
and the children in the apple tree
Not known because not looked for
But hear, half heard
In the stillness between two waves of the sea
